Focuses
======
I am a climate dynamics researcher and PhD candidate at the Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC), UNSW Sydney. My research investigates the role of moisture fluxes and multiscale interactions in regulating the propagation of convectively coupled equatorial waves, including Kelvin waves and the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO).

Combining theory-driven diagnostics with high-resolution global models (ICON, UM) and reanalysis datasets (ERA5), I develop process-based frameworks to quantify moisture–wave coupling and scale interactions. My broader goal is to improve the physical understanding of tropical variability and its representation in next-generation climate models.
